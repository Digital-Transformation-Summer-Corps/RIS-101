## Research Infrastructure Services Basics

Washington University Information Technology’s Research Infrastructure Services’ mission is to facilitate discovery of knowledge and enhance educational opportunities by providing secure, sustainable, scalable, and integrated research technology services in a collaborative and diverse environment.

### What is HPC?

- Computing that uses supercomputers and computer clusters to solve advanced computation problems.
- A supercomputer is a computer with more resources than what your average desktop or laptop computer has, often by orders of magnitude.
- Computer clusters are large amounts of computers networked together to be able to compute on tasks.

#### Average Computer Specs
- 1 TB Storage Space
- 1 CPU
- 8-16 GB RAM/Memory
- 1 GPU

#### RIS Storage Platform
- 30+ PB of Storage

#### RIS Compute Platform
- 10,000+ CPUs
- 120+ GPUs
- Up to 1TB RAM/Memory
